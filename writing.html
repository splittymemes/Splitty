<h1>Shits Crazy!</h1>
<h2>Not even lying</h2>
<p>Shits deadass Crazy right now. Like no cap, I was dead chillin with my boys when the craziest thing happened. We were all playing Xbox and then a girl walked in (totally unexpected) and was all like, “I’m finna take that.” We was all like HELL NA bruh like shit was crazy…. Anyway, this is sort of just an everyday occurrence for people like me (ie. elite downtown socialites in the alternative art scene) but like I was dead Trippin tho.
<br /><br />
  On the note of “Trippin”, here’s a little anecdote that’s bound to tickle your fancy; there I am at a Reading with all the most elite Socialites in downtown Mannahatta and I’m there, straight posted, with my dunce cap on No less. Basically (long story short) Shorty approaches me . “Whuz dat ‘pon yo head mistah?” needless to say, I slept with this woman. We made love till the sunrise. Every. Single. Position. Doggy style, cowboy, cowgirl, spindle, Xmas style, New Years, and even tantric massage. Basically, shit was epic.
  <br />  <br />
  Basically there was a party called “sex mag” party. Imagine a party that’s about SEX. Like…. Wtf?? Hell is hot my friends… hell is hot. I personally am SEX NEGATIVE. Which means I have a clear mind and am not clouded by thought of intercourse, intimacy, snugglez, or stroking. I never even think about girls, kissing, or privates. Doesn’t mean I’m an incel. I’m just a serious, traditional lad.</p>

    Bone Dry
    <br /><br />

Child celebrities who aged well<br />
The nuclear bomb of vagina<br />
An elk in the cotton lounge<br />
Begging for the crack pipe<br />
<br /><br />
I hang around your parents house<br />
I remember when we got hot chocolate in the second grade<br />
I remember the girls I fucked in Thailand<br />
I made them wear a wig that looked like your hair<br />
<br /><br />
You were anemic <br />
I liked Wong Kar Wai<br />
We hated popcorn<br />
And Mississippi blues<br />
<br /><br />
Now I think about world war 15<br />
And thick Mexican women<br />
I think about you and driving fast on a northwestern interstate<br />
Alone at the wheel, our cat is scratching the window<br />
